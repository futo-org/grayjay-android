        The [grayjay-android](https://github.com/futo-org/grayjay-android) issue tracker is reserved for issues relating to the Grayjay Android Application. Use the `Documentation` issue type to report problems with the documentation in our code repositories, inside the application, or on [https://grayjay.app](https://grayjay.app)
        Technical writers monitor this issue type, so report Grayjay bugs or feature requests with the `Bug report` or `Feature Request` issue types instead to get engineering attention.
