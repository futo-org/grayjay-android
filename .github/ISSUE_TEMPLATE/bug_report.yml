        ## Filing a bug report

        To fix your issues faster, we need clear reproduction cases - ideally allowing us to make it happen locally. 
        * Please include all needed context. For example, Device, OS, Application, your Grayjay Configurations and Plugin versioning info.
        * if you've found out a particular series of UI interactions can introduce buggy behavior, please label those steps 1-n with markdown
